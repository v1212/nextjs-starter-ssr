That night, he dreamt that his pot was overflowing with rice gruel and that if a famine came, he could sell the food and earn silver from it. This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.
Wrapped up in his dream the Brahmin picked up the stick near his bed and started hitting  the air with the stick.

One day, as he was going to enter a house, he heard barking. He was shocked to find a gang of dogs running towards the house. They looked violent and caused the jackal to panic. He ran and tumbled into a tub of blue dye. The dogs couldn’t see him and they ran another way.


Now the jackal was completely blue from head to toe. He appeared very different from any other animal. The jackal was pleased as no one would be able to recognize him and he could easily fool anyone in the jungle.
Just like he had thought, everyone in the jungle was surprised to see such an unusual animal.


The small animals, the lion and the tiger all asked who he was and who had sent him.
“I have been sent by God himself to look after you. I will now be the king of the jungle” The jackal said.


The lion protested saying he had always been the king of the forest.
“From now, that must change and all of you must serve me” The Jackal happily said.


Some animals like the tiger protested and asked what would happen if they didnt obey him. He replied saying God would destroy the entire jungle if they didn’t.


Scared for their lives and their jungle, the animals asked the blue Jackal what he would like them to do.
“Bring me lots of food” said the blue jackal promptly.
The animals quickly scurried and returned with lots of food for the Jackal.
He had so much food that he gave his leftovers to the other animals and told them that they had to serve him fresh food every day.
He even threw out the pack of jackals from the forest because he knew that they could identify him some day.


The blue Jackal was very happy with himself for fooling the entire forest and was happy to be away from the city dogs.
But one day the banned pack of jackals was walking around the forest and howling loudly. The blue jackal began howling out of habit too.

10 The Brahmins dream
A poor Brahmin lived in a village all alone. He had no friends or relatives. He was known for being stingy and he used to beg for a living. The food he got as alms were kept in an earthen pot which was hung beside his bed. This allowed him to easily access the food when he got hungry.  


On one day, he got so much rice gruel that even after completing his meal, there was so much leftover in his pot. That night, he dreamt that his pot was overflowing with rice gruel and that if a famine came, he could sell the food and earn silver from it. This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.
Wrapped up in his dream the Brahmin picked up the stick near his bed and started hitting  the air with the stick.

This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.

Now the jackal was completely blue from head to toe. He appeared very different from any other animal. The jackal was pleased as no one would be able to recognize him and he could easily fool anyone in the jungle.
Just like he had thought, everyone in the jungle was surprised to see such an unusual animal.


The small animals, the lion and the tiger all asked who he was and who had sent him.
“I have been sent by God himself to look after you. I will now be the king of the jungle” The jackal said.


The lion protested saying he had always been the king of the forest.
“From now, that must change and all of you must serve me” The Jackal happily said.

10 The Brahmins dream
A poor Brahmin lived in a village all alone. He had no friends or relatives. He was known for being stingy and he used to beg for a living. The food he got as alms were kept in an earthen pot which was hung beside his bed. This allowed him to easily access the food when he got hungry.  


On one day, he got so much rice gruel that even after completing his meal, there was so much leftover in his pot. That night, he dreamt that his pot was overflowing with rice gruel and that if a famine came, he could sell the food and earn silver from it. This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.
Wrapped up in his dream the Brahmin picked up the stick near his bed and started hitting  the air with the stick.
